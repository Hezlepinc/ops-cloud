- R1 — Vendor lock-in (WP AI): Driver abstraction + contract tests across drivers.
- R2 — Hosting API constraints: Maintain containerized WP path; keep staging mirrors.
- R3 — Model drift/regressions: Weekly eval suites; golden prompts; rollback-on-fail.
- R4 — Compliance/PII leakage: Segregate data, VPC inference, redaction filters.
- R5 — SEO volatility: Canary rollouts; experiment flags; synthetic checks pre‑prod.
- R6 — Cost spikes (LLM/hosting): Budget caps, autoscaling policies, provider benchmarks.
